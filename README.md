Explanation of project:

The purpose of this application is to help individuals organize his/her tasks.  The user can create an account, create, update, and delete tasks.  These tasks will be stored in a database for the user.  The user will need to sign up, sign in, and press "Get Tasks!‚Äù for a list of his/her current incomplete tasks.  As these tasks are created, there is a delete and update button next to each task which will allow the user to update a task or delete it off his/her task list.

Process

I started creating this app by creating user stories to help me determine the user experience I wanted. I started by building the back-end to help me determine the kind of data I wanted to store in my database. Then I created a basic HTML/CSS for a visual of what I wanted the app to entail and test the functionalities I was going to create.
